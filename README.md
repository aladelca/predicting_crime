# Forecasting number of victims because of gun shoots for a day span using ensemble tree methods and clustering techniques
## Introduction
The prevalence of gun violence currently stands as a significant challenge in the United States, posing a formidable task for authorities in terms of prevention and ensuring the safety of all citizens. The primary objective of this project is to, firstly, identify clusters of incidents based on location, the number of victims, and demographic data of the perpetrators. This is carried out with the aim of recognizing regions where gun-related crimes exhibit similar patterns. Subsequently, leveraging insights from these clusters, the second objective involves training a machine learning model to predict the number of victims anticipated on the following day. The ultimate goal is to facilitate proactive measures, resource allocation, and intervention strategies to address and mitigate the impact of these incidents, thereby preventing potential loss of life.
For the initial phase, incident-level data was employed, and the KMeans algorithm was utilized with 5 clusters determined through the elbow method. Transitioning to the subsequent stage, data was aggregated at the date and cluster levels. To enhance prediction accuracy, individual models were trained for each of the clusters. Additionally, experimentation was conducted with Boosting and Random Forest algorithms, for each cluster.
The approach adopted in this study involves training models to predict the number of victims related to firearm incidents expected on the following day. Given the temporal nature of the model and the training division by clusters, a validation scheme is proposed. This scheme entails training the model with data from 2014 to 2017, while the model's accuracy will be evaluated using data from 2018. Further details about the modeling strategy can be found in the corresponding section.
